Dirty Data Week

As our first project within Code Clan we were tasked to take as many of these datasets as possible within a week, clean them into serviceable datasets and answer questions on the analysis required. 

Due to the size of task 4 the majority of the week's work was taken up on that and tasks 2 and 3 were completed as extra experience. 

However going through each:

Task 1 is a data set on competitors in the olympics and other sporting tournaments which only took roughly a day to clean and answer. 

Task 2 was taking two datasets the first was a series of ingredients for cake recipes and the second was fully formed descriptions of each ingredient. These datasets were joined then we performed a pivot longer with the analysis questions focusing on finding different ingredients that made each cake.

Task 3 was about sighting seabirds where there was a lot of excess columns so a lot were taken out before the questions were answered. 

Task 4 was 3 years worth of surveys on Halloween candy on whether people thought they were good, bad or neutral. There were also many other superfluous questions being personal statements on the reader and many of the questions were people typing in their own answers so there was not a consistent answer for the country each participant was from. 

This task took up the majority of the week particularly cleaning the data as there were 106 columns with many unnecessary questions being taken out, names of columns to be changed and answers to questions made uniform to get a more accurate grip of the data.
